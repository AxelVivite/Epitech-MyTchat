# MyTchat

This project, developed in 2022 for an Epitech fullstack programming course, is an online chat application. It integrates a server-side architecture for storing messages, users, and groups, while leveraging websockets for real-time communication. On the frontend, it presents a user interface that enables seamless interaction and message display, providing a smooth chatting experience. The aim was to create an efficient, real-time chat system with proper handling of user data and conversations, emphasizing both backend and frontend collaboration.

This repository is a merge of two separate GitLab repositories: one for the frontend and the other for the backend. The commit history from both repositories has been preserved.
